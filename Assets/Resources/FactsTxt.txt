THE DARK SIDE OF THE MYTH
In reality both sides of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight however only one face of the Moon is ever seen from Earth.
GOODBYE MOON
The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year. It is estimated that it will continue to do so for around 50 billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will be taking around 47 days to orbit the Earth instead of the current 27.3 days.
SOLAR ECLIPSES
If any planets are in the sky at the time of a total solar eclipse, they can be seen as points of light.
THE GIANT MOON
Titan is the Saturnâ€™s largest moon and is the second largest moon in our solar system. If it were not orbiting Saturn, Titan could be considered a planet as it is larger than Mercury.
THE ICE MAN COMET
The nucleus of a comet is made of ice and can be as small as a few meters across to giant boulders a few kilometres across.
JUPITER'S EARTH MOON, CALLISTO
NASA once studied Callisto as a possible place to send human expeditions as a base for further exploration of the Jovian system. This mission might fly in the 2040 time frame.
THE COLOUR OF THE SUN
